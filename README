JActor is a Java version of the scala project, AsyncFP, a high-performance actor
implementation. (See https://github.com/laforge49/Asynchronous-Functional-Programming/wiki for more
information on AsyncFP.)

JActor currently implements only a very simple actor, JAEventActor, which sends 1-way messages, one
at a time. But even without any of the speed enhancements found in AsyncFP, the performance is
quite good.
