JActor is a Java version of the scala project, AsyncFP, a high-performance actor
implementation. (See https://github.com/laforge49/Asynchronous-Functional-Programming/wiki for more
information on AsyncFP.)

JActor currently implements only a very simple actor, JAEventActor, which sends 1-way messages, one
at a time.

A second actor, JABufferedEventsActor has also been implemented. An echo test running multiple pairs
processed 85 million messages per second--12 nanoseconds per message.

(Tests were done on an Intel Core i5 CPU M 540 @ 2.53GHz, which has 4 hardware threads. The times
reported were best run in 5.)
