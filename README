JActor is a Java version of the scala project, AsyncFP. This is a high-performance actor
implementation where messages are typically sent in about 100 nanoseconds.

See https://github.com/laforge49/Asynchronous-Functional-Programming/wiki for more
information on AsyncFP.

The first type of actor, JEEventActor takes 123 nanoseconds to send a message
when running with a single thread and 252 nanoseconds when running with multiple threads.

Tests were done on an Intel Core i5 CPU M 540 @ 2.53GHz.
