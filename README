JActor is a Java version of the scala project, AsyncFP, a high-performance actor
implementation. (See https://github.com/laforge49/Asynchronous-Functional-Programming/wiki for more
information on AsyncFP.)

JActor currently implements only a very simple actor, JAEventActor, which sends 1-way messages, one
at a time. But even without any of the speed enhancements found in AsyncFP, the performance is
quite good.

Using a simple echo test, JAEventActor takes 123 nanoseconds to send a message
when running with a single thread and 252 nanoseconds when running with multiple threads.

With a dual echo test. JAEventActor takes 60 nanoseconds to send a message
when running with a single thread, 144 nanoseconds when running with 2 threads,
137 nanoseconds when running with 4 threads and 133 nanoseconds when running
with 8 threads.

Tests were done on an Intel Core i5 CPU M 540 @ 2.53GHz, which has 4 hardware threads.
